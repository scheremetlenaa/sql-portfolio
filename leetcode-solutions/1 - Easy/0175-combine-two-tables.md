## Problem Statement

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

## Datasets used

```Person``` Table:

| Column Name | Type    |
| ------------|-------- |
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |

personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.

```Address``` Table:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |

addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.

## Solutions

```sql
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
    ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

## Result set

| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Allen     | Wang     | null          | null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
