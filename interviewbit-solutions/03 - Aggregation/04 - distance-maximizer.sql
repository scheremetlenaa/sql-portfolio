/* Given a table HOUSES, find the manhattan distance of the house which is the farthest from John’s house which lies at coordinates (20, 4).

Basically you have to find the manhattan distance of some house which is the maximum amongst all the other houses from John’s house.

Manhattan Distance between 2 points P(x1, y1), Q(x2, y2) is given as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. */

/* YOUR QUERY GOES HERE
   Example: SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;

SELECT
   MAX(ABS(XCoordinate - 20) + ABS(YCoordinate - 4)) AS A
FROM HOUSES;
