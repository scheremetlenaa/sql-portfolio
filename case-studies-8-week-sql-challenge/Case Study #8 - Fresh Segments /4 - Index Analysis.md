## Case Study Questions

The ```index_value``` is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the ```composition``` column by the ```index_value``` column rounded to 2 decimal places.

1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?
3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?
4. What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top ranking interests in the same output shown below.
5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

### 1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?

```sql
WITH avg_composition AS (
  SELECT
  	  month_year,
      interest_id,
      interest_name,
      ROUND((composition / index_value)::NUMERIC, 2) AS avg_composition
  FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics imt
  INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map imp
      ON imt.interest_id::NUMERIC = imp.id
),

ranked_avg_composition AS (
SELECT
    month_year,
    interest_id,
    interest_name,
    avg_composition,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY avg_composition DESC) AS dns_rnk
FROM avg_composition
)

SELECT
    month_year,
    interest_id,
    interest_name,
    avg_composition
FROM ranked_avg_composition
WHERE dns_rnk <= 10
ORDER BY 1, 4 DESC;
```
